  <h1>Javascript Loops</h1>
  <p>Everything is working in console. Code explanation is in the code comments.</p>
  <script>
    // for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    //   // code to be executed
    // }
    // The initialization the statement is executed before the loop starts and is typically used to initialize a counter variable. The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration and if it is true, the loop continues. If it is false, the loop exits. The increment/decrement statement is executed at the end of each iteration and is used to update the counter variable. Here's an example of a standard for loop that counts from 1 to 10:

    for (let i=0; i<=10; i++){
      console.log(i);
    }


    // For-in loop
    // The for-in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. It is similar to the for-of loop, but it iterates over the keys of an object instead of the values. Here's an example of a for-in loop that iterates over the properties of an object: It has the folllowing syntax
    
    // for (variable in object) {
    //   // code to be executed
    // }

    let person= {
      name : "ahmad",
      age : "20",
      country : "pakistan"
    }
    for (let key in person){
      console.log(key + " : " + person[key]);
    }


    // For-of loop
    // The for-of loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object, such as an array or a string. It has the following syntax:
    // for (variable of object) {
    //   // code to be executed
    // }
    let person2 = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"];
    for (let value of person2){
      console.log(value);
    }
